# Indian-Premier-League-IPL-Cricket-Match-Analysis
This project analyses ball-by-ball IPL data to understand which strategies are important for winning matches. I’ve looked at how the toss, venues, and individual players’ performances in crucial stages (Powerplay &amp; Death overs) affect the matches. The goal is to transform complex data into simple insights for team strategy.
